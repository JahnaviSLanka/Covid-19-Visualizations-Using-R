# Introduction about Covid-19

The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a highly contagious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome. The known symptoms of this virus are flu like and can affect a human being within a span of 2-14 days of exposure. Since this a current pandemic and as of today there are 2402076 reported confirmed cases, 165106 deaths and 623911 recovered cases worldwide. 

The visualization used in this project explored the initiation, expansion and impact of the virus by breaking it down from a global scale to a regional scale based on which it drew inferences in terms of statistical numbers and how it has an influence on the mankind which has resulted to a lockdown in almost every other nation where the virus continues to exist.
 
# Data Collection

Data collection and cleaning was done by each individual member of this team and sources of the datasets used in this project are from the following:
https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/situation-reports/ 
https://www.coronainusa.com 
https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report

# Packages

The packages of ggplot2, ggrepel, map, mapproj, plotly and ggthemes, lubridate, dplyr and readxl from the statistical programming language R was used for Data Visualization in terms of Grouped Bar, Donut, Map and MultiLine charts.

# Abstract 

The project was based on the current and mounting pandemic named Corona Virus. I was able to visualize how this virus had originated in China and spreading rapidly on a global scale. With the help of Bar and Donut charts, it was easier to perceive how the virus augmented and extended during the span of 3 months in various regions of China; some of them which includes Guangdong, Zhejiang, Henan and Hunan provinces. Since the disease is contagious and has affected various other countries, with the help of multiline charts comparisons are done for confirmed, deaths and recoveries across severely affected nations such as USA, Italy, Spain, Germany, UK, France, Belgium, Russia, Iran and Turkey. Map and bubble chart also enabled one to visualize the impact of the virus universally. Additionally, the virus has impacted the one of the leading nations in the world more harshly out of all and with the help of the visualization like choropleth and bubble chart included in this project, one can envision the confirmed, death and recovered cases across all the states of United States of America. 

# Conclusion

The following inferences were made after analyzing data and the plots used in this project:
1. The virus which originated in Wuhan City, China although high in number before, the daily active new cases have been decreasing and      their current mortality rate out of the confirmed cases is observed to be 6% 
2. The country with the maximum reported confirmed cases and deaths is USA and its still rising. 
3. Out of the top 10 countries affected most by COVID-19, the country with the maximum recovered cases out of confirmed is Germany          standing strong at 95%. 
4. Geovisualization using bubble map has proved to be ideal for keeping a track of COVID-19.
